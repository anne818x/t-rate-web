                    <b>Leaving a review</b>
                    <br>
                    When creating a review for a teacher, you will rate the teacher in five categories. Each category 
                    is rated out of five stars. When you have rated the teacher in each category, you then leave a comment
                    about the teacher. This is where you will write your own opinion of this teacher. 
                    <br>
                    T-rate doesn't tolerate profanity, please refain from using it. There is a check in place if you do use
                    any profanity words. 
                    <br>
                    You may only leave a review once per module, this restricts the user from spamming and making a genuine 
                    review.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Reporting/ Deleting</b>
                    <br>
                    If you see a review that you believe is not fair, improper comment or spamming, it is possible to report
                    that review. Once the review has been reported, an admin will look at this and decide whether it should
                    be removed or not. <br>
                    When you log in you will get automatically directed to the user profile page. Once on there you will see all
                    your reviews that you have left. On this page you are allowed to delete your own review, as an option.

                    <b>Teacher not listed?</b>

                   <h3> Do you want to get your favourite teacher on the Hall of Fame? </h3>
                   The Hall of Fame is what all Stenden teachers are aiming for. They want to show that they're the best 
                   at Stenden University. To do that they need you to review them, on T-rate. Each new review will count 
                   towards the overall score of each teacher <b>BUT</b> you may only make one review per module. 
                   It is all up to the teacher to the reviews up, to become the Top-rated teacher of that module. 
                   There are six categories in which Stenden teachers could win an award, they're:
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Best Atmosphere,
                <br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Best Professional, 
                 <br> 
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Most Helpfulness, 
                 <br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Best Lectures, 
                 <br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Best Preparation 
                 <br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• and the one all of the teachers want the Top-rated teacher. 
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                 At the end of each module it will be generated who is the best out of each catergory and each
                 teacher will get a badge shown on their page. Another thing that the teacher will recieve is a 
                 coupon to get a free cookie. 
                 <br>
                <br>
                 Make sure that you review your favourite teacher to get them one step closer to that cookie.
